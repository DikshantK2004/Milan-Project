## Introduction

Welcome to our project repository for the MILAN Hostel Inter-Hostel Hackathon! This repository contains all the code and resources for our project, which is focused on categorizing laptops based on their features using a sentiment analysis model.

In this competition, we aimed to build a web application that not only helps users identify the features of laptops but also provides sentiment analysis of reviews related to those laptops.

## Project Description

In this project, we have created a web application that allows users to:

- Browse and search for different laptop models.
- View detailed specifications and features of each laptop.
- Submit reviews and opinions on laptops.
- Utilize a sentiment analysis model to determine the sentiment of user reviews.

Our sentiment analysis model helps users understand the general sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the reviews related to a particular laptop. This can be helpful for users who are considering purchasing a laptop and want to gauge customer satisfaction.

## Features

- Laptop categorization based on features.
- Detailed laptop specifications and features.
- User review submission and display.
- Sentiment analysis of user reviews.
- User-friendly web interface.
